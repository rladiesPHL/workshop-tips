# Guide for Workshops

*R-Ladies Philadelphia*

So you want to lead an interactive workshop!

## Checklist 

1. Develop your content (see tips below)
1. Practice or ask others to test it out (does it take 5 minutes? 5 hours?)
1. If needed, identify volunteers to help troubleshoot with attendees
1. Check that the venue has internet available (unless not needed)
1. Share any instructions and required materials ahead of the event
1. Share materials online (GitHub is preferred)

## Tips  

1. Generally, there should be more time spent doing exercises and interactive portions than delivering introductions and content
1. There are several options for how to deliver content:
	+ Slides with live demo and walk-through
	+ Slides with exercises
	+ Chalk/White board with R exercises
	+ Use Rmd instead of slides
1. Consider using RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide)
	+ *There is a default max number of users for a project, but you can contact RStudio to request more space. Plan ahead to ask for more space.*
1. If many non-base or uncommon packages will be needed, consider providing these instructions ahead of time, or having them ready in RStudio Cloud.
1. Share code ahead of time using GitHub
	+ If you are new to GitHub, we can help you set up a repository and add materials. We have done this for other workshop leads - no problem.
1. One great approach is to get people excited by showing them the end result and then backing up to the beginning to show them how to get there. See more [here](https://speakerdeck.com/minecr/let-them-eat-cake-first-0a3bbf75-f6f1-42d5-8d2f-ac2ff741611f).
1. Timing - probably prepare less than you think
1. Consider varying the difficulty of content - maybe for each part there can be an easy bit and a stretch bit for advanced attendees or for people to try after the event
1. *Virtual events*: For online events, there are several ways that Q&A can be handled. Platforms like zoom have the chat for asking questions and the webinar feature of zoom has a special Q&A feature. However, the questions in chat can be difficult to manage by the presenter. Therefore, we like having a dedicated host or assistant to collect questions and either answer them in real-time or collect to share with the workhop presenter at breaks. To do this, the event organizers can create a Q&A google doc. See this [example](https://bit.ly/304YP7x).
1. Understand that things will definitely go wrong and that is ok :)
1. Data availability considerations: you will probably be using some dataset for demonstration.   
	+ You should check whether this data can be shared with this audience and is free and open to use for educational purposes. 
	+ Base R and many R packages have datasets packaged with them (e.g., mtcars). These can be good places to start as they are easy for everyone to use.
	+ If your dataset is very large and would need to be downloaded, consider modifying to use a small subset of the data that can be easily shared.
	+ We recommend choosing a fun or simulated dataset to keep the focus of the workshop on the material being taught. It can be challenging to present on a dataset from a field you are not an expert in.
